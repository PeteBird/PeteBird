# Greetings Programs

- 👋  Hi, I’m @PeteBird, a recovering Network Engineer who made the leap to cloud and that DevOps life. I am now a cloud consultant focusing primarily on the AWS platform.
- 🏄‍♂️  In my spare time, I surf whenever possible. I also hike, run, swim, snowboard, camp, etc. Basically I try to balance out all the time I spend in front of my computer.
- 🤔  I created this account as a learning tool, to put myself out there so-to-speak, and perhaps as a way to hold myself more accountable for some of the cloudy things I create.
- 👀  I’m interested in Infra as Code, Networking (of course), Automation, Containers, K8s, all things security.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Python, Go, JQuery, and Javascript.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on all the things, and to make the world a better place through \<insert industry buzzword-speak\>
- 📫  How to reach me: GitHub, KeyBase, Matrix.

Namaste.

-Bird
